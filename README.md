##Exercise:

Design and build a React Native mobile app OR web application that fetches and displays Artist data from the following iTunes url:
https://itunes.apple.com/search?term={Replace Any Artist Name}

##Functionality:

When the web app is launched, it should display a button (can be placed anywhere on the screen) named ‘Show Records’.
When tapped on the button, a spinner should be shown until the data is downloaded. Once the data is available, the spinner should be dismissed and a scrollable list of the artist’s tracks should be shown. Each item in the list should contain the following data:

artistName

trackName TrackPrice

releaseDate

         primaryGenreName

##Preferred TechStack:

React: https://github.com/facebook/react/
Redux: https://github.com/reduxjs/redux
Saga: https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga
Selector: https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect
Axios: https://github.com/axios/axios
Jest: https://github.com/facebook/jest (Testing)

Utilizing the above techstack for the coding exercise is preferred. If you’re comfortable using a different library/techstack other than the ones stated above, please free to do so.

##Testing:

Including unit tests is highly recommended as part of the coding exercise

Note: Please submit your final code through a Github link

NOTE: It’s highly recommended if you build a Mobile App. That said, if you are running short on time or have never build mobile apps before, a web application would also suffice for the hands-on coding interview.
